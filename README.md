As a daily motorcycle rider, I often face one of the biggest challenges: staying awake during late-night rides after a long day of work. The drowsiness creeps in, and let’s face it—riding while sleepy is downright dangerous. That’s when I realized I needed a solution, and the idea for the Night Glow Smart Helmet was born.

This isn’t your regular helmet. I integrated an IMU sensor hooked up with cutting-edge Edge AI to detect signs of drowsiness. The second it senses I’m about to doze off, it sends a vibration alert to keep me awake and aware. But I didn’t stop there—why not make safety look good too? I added vibrant lights to the helmet, making it not only functional but also undeniably cool for nighttime rides.
